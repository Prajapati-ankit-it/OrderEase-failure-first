# OrderEase - Failure-Resilient Ordering System

A production-grade restaurant ordering system demonstrating **distributed systems patterns** for high-reliability order processing. Built to showcase event sourcing, idempotency, and failure recovery in a real-world domain.

> **Problem**: How do you guarantee exactly-once semantics and financial consistency in a distributed system where servers crash, networks fail, and clients retry?

> **Solution**: Event-sourced state + idempotent APIs + recovery workers with DB-level locking.

## 🎯 Core Design Principles

- **Failure-first design**: System assumes crashes and network failures will occur
- **Event-sourced state**: Order lifecycle tracked as append-only events (audit trail + time travel)
- **Idempotent workflows**: Client retries are safe; duplicate requests return cached results
- **Integer-based currency**: All amounts stored as cents to avoid IEEE-754 precision issues
- **Autonomous recovery**: Background workers detect and resolve stuck payments/refunds
- **Distributed locking**: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` prevents concurrent processing by replicas
- **State machine validation**: All order transitions validated; invalid transitions rejected

## 📊 Order Lifecycle (State Machine)

Orders transition through a well-defined state machine, derived from the event log:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   PENDING   │ ← Initial state (ORDER_REQUESTED)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓ Cart validated, items snapshotted (ORDER_VALIDATED)
┌─────────────┐
│  CONFIRMED  │ ← Payment initiated (PAYMENT_INITIATED)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├─→ Payment succeeds (PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED) ──→ CONFIRMED (terminal)
       │
       └─→ Payment fails (PAYMENT_FAILED) ──────→ FAILED (terminal)

Cancellation path:
CONFIRMED + ORDER_CANCELLED → Refund eligibility evaluated
  ↓
PAYMENT_REFUNDED event → Refund issued (terminal)
```

**Key Insight**: Current state is **derived** from events. No state is stored—it's computed by replaying events. This enables:
- **Audit trail**: Full history of what happened and when
- **Time travel**: Replay events to reproduce any historical state
- **Recovery**: Workers query events to detect stuck orders

## 🔥 Chaos Scenarios & Recovery Guarantees

### Scenario 1: Server Crashes After PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED

**What Happens:**
- Payment gateway confirms success
- `PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED` event written to DB
- Server crashes before emitting `ORDER_CONFIRMED`

**Recovery:**
State derivation treats `PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED` as terminal:
```typescript
deriveOrderState([
  { type: 'PAYMENT_INITIATED' },
  { type: 'PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED' }
]);
// → OrderState.CONFIRMED
```
No `ORDER_CONFIRMED` event needed. Payment success = order complete.

**Guarantee:**
- ✅ Payment processed exactly once (gateway idempotency by payment ID)
- ✅ Order state always derivable from events
- ✅ No duplicate charges (idempotency key prevents retries from creating new payments)

---

### Scenario 2: Client Retries Checkout Multiple Times

**What Happens:**
Client submits checkout with `idempotencyKey`. Request times out. Client retries with same key.

**Recovery:**
```typescript
const existing = await tx.idempotencyKey.findUnique({ where: { key } });
if (existing) return existing.response.orderId; // ← Cached result
```
Idempotency key stored **in same transaction** as order creation. Either both succeed or both roll back.

**Guarantee:**
- ✅ Checkout is exactly-once at business level
- ✅ No zombie orders (transaction atomicity)
- ✅ Safe for network failures (clients can always retry)

---

### Scenario 3: Worker Crashes Mid-Payment Processing

**What Happens:**
Payment stuck in `INITIATED` state (gateway timeout, network failure). `PaymentRecoveryWorker` runs every 30 seconds:

```sql
SELECT id, "orderId"
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'INITIATED' AND "createdAt" < (NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute')
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
LIMIT 10
```

**Critical Pattern**: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- Multiple replicas run concurrently
- Each worker "claims" payments via row-level locking
- `SKIP LOCKED` prevents blocking on already-claimed rows
- Crash → locks released → payment becomes claimable again

**Recovery:**
Worker retries. Processing is idempotent (gateway recognizes duplicate payment IDs).

**Guarantee:**
- ✅ Payments eventually resolved (workers retry until terminal state)
- ✅ No two workers process same payment simultaneously
- ✅ Worker crashes don't lose work (locks auto-released)

---

### Scenario 4: Order Cancelled After Payment Success

**What Happens:**
1. Payment succeeds (`PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED`)
2. User cancels (`ORDER_CANCELLED` event)
3. System must issue refund

**Recovery:**
`RefundRecoveryWorker` queries for refund-eligible orders:
```sql
SELECT p."orderId"
FROM payments p
WHERE p.status = 'SUCCEEDED'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_events WHERE "orderId" = p."orderId" AND type = 'ORDER_CANCELLED')
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM payments WHERE "orderId" = p."orderId" AND status = 'REFUNDED')
FOR UPDATE OF p SKIP LOCKED
```

Worker calls `RefundOrchestrator.initiateRefund()`, which emits `PAYMENT_REFUNDED` event.

**Guarantee:**
- ✅ Refunds are idempotent (gateway deduplicates by refund ID)
- ✅ No double refunds (event log + payment status prevent reprocessing)
- ✅ Eventually consistent (worker retries on timeout)
- ✅ Audit trail (`PAYMENT_REFUNDED` event = proof of refund)
